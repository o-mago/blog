  "articleBody": "Brief unrelated to the theme info:\nThis is my first blog post in a while and the first here, at my personal website 😄 (I used to post at Medium before). Before going to the subject I would like to say that I’m not using any AI to write this, I really want to put my thoughts in the texts you see here. These are my thoughts now, at the date I’m posting this, and it can change with time. There are some jokes about JS, but it’s all just for humor purposes, don’t be mad 😉\nWhy this theme:\nI took some time choosing the title of the post, I wanted to play with a song name, the first one that came to my mind was “Should I stay or should I go?” by The Clash, a really great song. But then my curiosity made me search for other songs with the word “go”. And there are a lot.\n“Go”, by Pearl Jam, “Go”, by Blink-182, “Go”, by Indigo Girls, “Go”, by Kelly Clarkson, “Go”, by The Smashing Pumpkins, “Go”, by Def Leppard, “Go Go Go”, by Chuck Berry, “Here I Go Again”, by Whitesnake, “Go All the Way” by Raspberries, “Go Your Own Way” by Fleetwood Mac … and the list Goes on!\nAfter some consideration, I found out I had lost lots of time searching and listening to songs and I decided to Go 🤭 with The Clash.\nBut it fits perfectly to the theme. I’m also a mentor at adplist, and many of my mentees ask me this question of the title. Ok, not exactly like that, but like “should I learn Go?”, “why do you like Go?”\nThe first question is hard to answer, but as a senior engineer I have the answer: “It depends”. Usually I start asking, not answering, because it depends on each ones reallity. I will not dive into this question today (maybe in another post). Today I want to talk about the second one, maybe it help you reflect about the first one and clear things for you, maybe not.\nI want to tell my story, how I ended up working with Go, when it started, what I learned along the way, and finally why do I chose to keep Going?\nHow it started:\nMy first contact with Golang was in a cold night (not that cold, this is Brazil) in September 2020. I was working with Javascript at that time, I was unhappy (of course, it’s JS 🤪) and wanted to change jobs. A friend of mine was working in a company using Go and said they were looking for engineers, and wanted to refer me. I didn’t know Go at the time (just by name), but he said the language was great. I was unsure, but I accepted it and started the selective process.\nThe first step was a leetcode like challenge, but it wasn’t mandatory to use Go. But I wanted to show “I’m a fast learner”, so I took one day to study the documentation and did some basic leetcode with it. At that point I knew I wasn’t that fast, actually the language is “fast learnable”. I took the test the next day and passed.\nThis were the first characteristics of the language that I noticed:\n“It is fast to learn”\n“It has an amazing and intuitive documentation”\nAt that point I was convinced to give it a try if I got the job.\nI got the job and then the more I dived into the language, tools and the community, the more I fell in love with it ❤️\nSo let’s break into these and other reasons of why I fell in love:\nGreat Documentation:\nWhy the documentation is great?\nIt’s meant for learners, when you enter the https://go.dev/doc/ webpage you don’t see lot’s of texts and references etc. You see lot’s of links to resources for learning, tutorials, examples, good practices, guidelines, explaining the internals. It has resources for starters and for who wants to dive into the internals of Go, like how the garbage collector works. They make it easy for use to start using, but they want you to understand how Go works, really understand what you are doing\nOne of the main parts is the https://go.dev/learn/ section. It’s so amazing, it’s where I first learned Go, and that’s my suggestion to all my mentees and everyone that asks. I’m not a video tutorial fan, so I tend to prefer written material.\nIt tells you all very straight forward starting with how to install. Then you have the amazing “Tour of Go” (https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1), where it will teach you all the basics with splited sections and interactive examples for you to run using the Go Playground. It’s great because many people get afraid when they see lot’s of texts, without a certain order, they freeze. The “Tour of Go” take you by the hand in a linear path through the magical world of the Gopher, with compiled information, just what you need to get an idea of how everything works without letting your memory overflow. At the end gives you a ton of links to deep dive into some subjects, like concurrency, some more practical tutorials, like web servers, CLIs\nYou have also the “Go by Example” (https://gobyexample.com/), that gives you a brief explanation and examples for common Go usage. It’s great because it has an index with the subject associated, something to help you remember some stuff without having to go though the tour all over again. These 2 are a great combo for starters. And if want to expand more, there’s the “Go Specification” https://go.dev/ref/spec\nAnd of course you have the amazing “Effective Go”, a guideline to write idiomatic golang. It’s a must read. I know it’s long, like this blog post is becoming, but it’s worth your time.\nThe “Release Notes” https://go.dev/doc/devel/release are amazing, always summarizing the main changes in the language first, then they go tool by tool, package by package. It’s really made for humans to read, and it’s great as a guide to understand the impact on your code, you can easily look each topic, see what can impact you and test or change your code to use the newest modifications.\nAnd of course we cannot forget the “Standard Library Reference” https://pkg.go.dev/std. It has all the packages, all the functions, methods, explanations and examples. It’s amazing\nFast to learn\nI experienced this and have listened from many others the same. Why?\nIt becomes pretty obvious after the last paragraphs I wrote about the documentation 😄. It really has a way to onboard you fast and let you dive into the language as you need and want.\nBut it’s not only that, there’s more…\nGo is simple\nJust looking at some data, Go is one of the mainstream languages with less reserved words:\nJava: \u003e 60\nJavascript: \u003e 50\nRust: \u003e 35\nPython: \u003e 30\nGo: 25\nHow is that possible? A simple example that I like is that you don’t have while, you just use for without condition\nGo tries (almost always) to be concise, to have fewer as possible ways of doing the same thing. It want to give you tools (types, functions, methods) to allow you to build your logic, not to build everyones logic and packet it. For example, we don’t have for and foreach like in JS. Of course there are methods from the slices package to sort, compare and we have iterators now. But all of them have their purpose, it’s no simply a way to avoid creating a i variable in the for loop. You could argue that in Go there is the range to do something similar the foreach does. But it has more specific uses, like range over channels.\nBecause of this simplicity, go is easy to read, even the standard library internal code, they really do what they suggest you to do. Go is humble, it doesn’t try to be unnecessarily clever and fancy, it just do the work.\nSimplicity has a strong relation with being explicit in this case, and some times it has it’s price, more code written, like in the case of error handling in go 😬\nGo is reliable\nGo has the philosophy of backwards compatibility at all cost, avoiding breaking changes on major or minor versions. It happened in the past of course, there’s the famous loopvar change (https://go.dev/blog/loopvar-preview) where they changed how the loop variable behaves. It was in many cases the root of bugs, but that’s because of a dissonance between the behaviour and what most people expected, and at the end it was just behaviour. And the behaviour changed, maybe someone was rellying on the way things were, and the fix actually caused a new bug. Who knows? Not me, I read the release notes every time. That’s why I always advise you to read it to before uptading your go version, specially if it’s a major version\nAlthough we don’t have an exact date of release of new go versions, we can count on 2 major releases a year.\nGo improves\nGo is always seeking improvent, in all areas, performance of the compiler, of the packages, like faster json encoding and bringing new toys, like iterators and generics. I don’t know you, but for me all this effort to bring new features, improve things gets me excited like a new videogame console will be launched or a new star wars movie will be released (when they were good).\nI know many of this stuff is not new, like generics or pgo. But all of it is thought carefully and discussed in community before being merged. And I think Go and it’s community are a ecossystem that revives and bring light to some old tech in a way that people think it’s new. Because they do in a developer friendly way, like PGO. It was already a thing on C++ and other languages. But if you search PGO today, the majority of content, posts, talks will be related to Golang.\nThe Community\nThis is another great point, golang has an active community of enthusiasts, you have official channels for it, slack, google groups and even the go repository is a great place to get involved into discussions inside the issues, you can point improvents or bugs and collaborate through pull requests.\nThere are tons of golang groups and conferences and I see more and more starting. Here in Brazil we have meetups, like Golang SP, Floripa Gophers, many GDGs around the country talk about golang, and of course there are the main conferences all over the globe, like Gophercon Latam, Golab, Gophercon US, Gophercon UK etc… And many other conferences have some space for golang talks, specially devops ones, like DevOps Days, Container Days. And there’s space for beginners and experts, every conference I attended people are nice, and opened to help someone that’s struggling to start with the language.\nLet’s not forget the newsletters, we have the “Golang Weekly” (https://golangweekly.com/) and for the portuguese speakers, thanks to Elton Minetto, there is thed “A Semana Go” https://www.asemanago.dev/. This way you can always keep up to date with news about the language and interesting projects.\nI know it’s not everyone that wants to think about programming after work, but if you want and enjoy, there are so many resources and people that share the same feeling and excitement about Go.\nConcurrency made easy\nPerformance\nYou probably was waiting for me to come to this topic, everyone talks about that. But for me and maybe the most part of the developers should be the least important. This is not why I use Go, every company I worked for, every system I built could have been built with other languages (even JS 🤢). Most of us don’t count microseconds of performance\nAnd we have lot’s of benchmarks all over the internet stating that language X is better than language Y. And most of this benchmarks have shady methodology and lots of biases. A benchmark is a scientific research, it must have a well defined plan and consider it’s limitations. There are numerous situations to test, numerous structures and algorithms that these tests will never touch. There are compilation and interpretation improvements that can happen if you run the same code more than once. Maybe a language has a faster encoding of json but the other is faster for decoding because of the implementation in each one. And usually the person comparing tech A to tech B is expert with A and has a basic understanding of B, of course is easier for them to extract more performance of A.\nBut yeah, Go is fast, and you can build your web server, it will handle your load, you probably don’t need Rust or Zig for it. Remembering that the language is just part of your latency, usually we have lot’s of components on the way, containers clusters, lot’s of network hops, load balancers, api gateways etc…\n",

<p>“Go”, by Pearl Jam, “Go”, by Blink-182, “Go”, by Indigo Girls,  “Go”, by Kelly Clarkson,  &ldquo;Go&rdquo;, by The Smashing Pumpkins, &ldquo;Go&rdquo;, by Def Leppard, &ldquo;Go Go Go&rdquo;, by Chuck Berry, “Here I Go Again”, by Whitesnake, “Go All the Way” by Raspberries, “Go Your Own Way” by Fleetwood Mac … and the list Goes on!</p>
<p>After some consideration, I found out I had lost lots of time searching and listening to songs and I decided to Go 🤭 with The Clash.</p>
<p>But it fits perfectly to the theme. I’m also a mentor at adplist, and many of my mentees ask me this question of the title. Ok, not exactly like that, but like “should I learn Go?”, “why do you like Go?”</p>
<p>The first question is hard to answer, but as a senior engineer I have the answer: “It depends”. Usually I start asking, not answering, because it depends on each ones reallity. I will not dive into this question today (maybe in another post). Today I want to talk about the second one, maybe it help you reflect about the first one and clear things for you, maybe not.</p>
<p>I want to tell my story, how I ended up working with Go, when it started, what I learned along the way, and finally why do I chose to keep Going?</p>
<p>How it started:</p>
<p>My first contact with Golang was in a cold night (not that cold, this is Brazil) in September 2020. I was working with Javascript at that time, I was unhappy (of course, it’s JS 🤪) and wanted to change jobs. A friend of mine was working in a company using Go and said they were looking for engineers, and wanted to refer me. I didn’t know Go at the time (just by name), but he said the language was great. I was unsure, but I accepted it and started the selective process.</p>
<p>The first step was a leetcode like challenge, but it wasn’t mandatory to use Go. But I wanted to show “I’m a fast learner”, so I took one day to study the documentation and did some basic leetcode with it. At that point I knew I wasn’t that fast, actually the language is “fast learnable”. I took the test the next day and passed.</p>
<p>This were the first characteristics of the language that I noticed:</p>
<p>“It is fast to learn”</p>
<p>“It has an amazing and intuitive documentation”</p>
<p>At that point I was convinced to give it a try if I got the job.</p>
<p>I got the job and then the more I dived into the language, tools and the community, the more I fell in love with it ❤️</p>
<p>So let’s break into these and other reasons of why I fell in love:</p>
<p>Great Documentation:</p>
<p>Why the documentation is great?</p>
<p>It’s meant for learners, when you enter the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/">https://go.dev/doc/</a> webpage you don’t see lot’s of texts and references etc. You see lot’s of links to resources for learning, tutorials, examples, good practices, guidelines, explaining the internals. It has resources for starters and for who wants to dive into the internals of Go, like how the garbage collector works. They make it easy for use to start using, but they want you to understand how Go works, really understand what you are doing</p>
<p>One of the main parts is the <a href="https://go.dev/learn/">https://go.dev/learn/</a> section. It’s so amazing, it’s where I first learned Go, and that’s my suggestion to all my mentees and everyone that asks. I’m not a video tutorial fan, so I tend to prefer written material.</p>
<p>It tells you all very straight forward starting with how to install. Then you have the amazing “Tour of Go” (<a href="https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1%29">https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1)</a>, where it will teach you all the basics with splited sections and interactive examples for you to run using the Go Playground. It’s great because many people get afraid when they see lot’s of texts, without a certain order, they freeze. The “Tour of Go” take you by the hand in a linear path through the magical world of the Gopher, with compiled information, just what you need to get an idea of how everything works without letting your memory overflow. At the end gives you a ton of links to deep dive into some subjects, like concurrency, some more practical tutorials, like web servers, CLIs</p>
<p>You have also the “Go by Example” (<a href="https://gobyexample.com/%29">https://gobyexample.com/)</a>, that gives you a brief explanation and examples for common Go usage. It’s great because it has an index with the subject associated, something to help you remember some stuff without having to go though the tour all over again. These 2 are a great combo for starters. And if want to expand more, there’s the “Go Specification” <a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec">https://go.dev/ref/spec</a></p>
<p>And of course you have the amazing “Effective Go”, a guideline to write idiomatic golang. It’s a must read. I know it’s long, like this blog post is becoming, but it’s worth your time.</p>
<p>The “Release Notes” <a href="https://go.dev/doc/devel/release">https://go.dev/doc/devel/release</a> are amazing, always summarizing the main changes in the language first, then they go tool by tool, package by package. It’s really made for humans to read, and it’s great as a guide to understand the impact on your code, you can easily look each topic, see what can impact you and test or change your code to use the newest modifications.</p>
<p>And of course we cannot forget the “Standard Library Reference” <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/std">https://pkg.go.dev/std</a>. It has all the packages, all the functions, methods, explanations and examples. It’s amazing</p>
<p>Fast to learn</p>
<p>I experienced this and have listened from many others the same. Why?</p>
<p>It becomes pretty obvious after the last paragraphs I wrote about the documentation 😄. It really has a way to onboard you fast and let you dive into the language as you need and want.</p>
<p>But it’s not only that, there’s more…</p>
<p>Go is simple</p>
<p>Just looking at some data, Go is one of the mainstream languages with less reserved words:</p>
<p>Java: &gt; 60</p>
<p>Javascript: &gt; 50</p>
<p>Rust: &gt; 35</p>
<p>Python: &gt; 30</p>
<p>Go: 25</p>
<p>How is that possible? A simple example that I like is that you don’t have <code>while</code>, you just use <code>for</code> without condition</p>
<p>Go tries (almost always) to be concise, to have fewer as possible ways of doing the same thing. It want to give you tools (types, functions, methods) to allow you to build your logic, not to build everyones logic and packet it. For example, we don’t have <code>for</code> and <code>foreach</code> like in JS. Of course there are methods from the slices package to sort, compare and we have iterators now. But all of them have their purpose, it’s no simply a way to avoid creating a <code>i</code> variable in the for loop. You could argue that in Go there is the <code>range</code> to do something similar the <code>foreach</code> does. But it has more specific uses, like range over channels.</p>
<p>Because of this simplicity, go is easy to read, even the standard library internal code, they really do what they suggest you to do. Go is humble, it doesn’t try to be unnecessarily clever and fancy, it just do the work.</p>
<p>Simplicity has a strong relation with being explicit in this case, and some times it has it’s price, more code written, like in the case of error handling in go 😬</p>
<p>Go is reliable</p>
<p>Go has the philosophy of backwards compatibility at all cost, avoiding breaking changes on major or minor versions. It happened in the past of course, there’s the famous loopvar change (<a href="https://go.dev/blog/loopvar-preview">https://go.dev/blog/loopvar-preview</a>) where they changed how the loop variable behaves. It was in many cases the root of bugs, but that’s because of a dissonance between the behaviour and what most people expected, and at the end it was just behaviour. And the behaviour changed, maybe someone was rellying on the way things were, and the fix actually caused a new bug. Who knows? Not me, I read the release notes every time. That’s why I always advise you to read it to before uptading your go version, specially if it’s a major version</p>
<p>Although we don’t have an exact date of release of new go versions, we can count on 2 major releases a year.</p>
<p>Go improves</p>
<p>Go is always seeking improvent, in all areas, performance of the compiler, of the packages, like faster json encoding and bringing new toys, like iterators and generics. I don’t know you, but for me all this effort to bring new features, improve things gets me excited like a new videogame console will be launched or a new star wars movie will be released (when they were good).</p>
<p>I know many of this stuff is not new, like generics or pgo. But all of it is thought carefully and discussed in community before being merged. And I think Go and it’s community are a ecossystem that revives and bring light to some old tech in a way that people think it’s new. Because they do in a developer friendly way, like PGO. It was already a thing on C++ and other languages. But if you search PGO today, the majority of content, posts, talks will be related to Golang.</p>
<p>The Community</p>
<p>This is another great point, golang has an active community of enthusiasts, you have official channels for it, slack, google groups and even the go repository is a great place to get involved into discussions inside the issues, you can point improvents or bugs and collaborate through pull requests.</p>
<p>There are tons of golang groups and conferences and I see more and more starting. Here in Brazil we have meetups, like Golang SP, Floripa Gophers, many GDGs around the country talk about golang, and of course there are the main conferences all over the globe, like Gophercon Latam, Golab, Gophercon US, Gophercon UK etc… And many other conferences have some space for golang talks, specially devops ones, like DevOps Days, Container Days. And there’s space for beginners and experts, every conference I attended people are nice, and opened to help someone that’s struggling to start with the language.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget the newsletters, we have the “Golang Weekly” (<a href="https://golangweekly.com/">https://golangweekly.com/</a>) and for the portuguese speakers, thanks to Elton Minetto, there is thed “A Semana Go” <a href="https://www.asemanago.dev/">https://www.asemanago.dev/</a>. This way you can always keep up to date with news about the language and interesting projects.</p>
<p>I know it’s not everyone that wants to think about programming after work, but if you want and enjoy, there are so many resources and people that share the same feeling and excitement about Go.</p>
<p>Concurrency made easy</p>
<p>Performance</p>
<p>You probably was waiting for me to come to this topic, everyone talks about that. But for me and maybe the most part of the developers should be the least important. This is not why I use Go, every company I worked for, every system I built could have been built with other languages (even JS 🤢). Most of us don’t count microseconds of performance</p>
<p>And we have lot’s of benchmarks all over the internet stating that language X is better than language Y.  And most of this benchmarks have shady methodology and lots of biases. A benchmark is a scientific research, it must have a well defined plan and consider it’s limitations. There are numerous situations to test, numerous structures and algorithms that these tests will never touch. There are compilation and interpretation improvements that can happen if you run the same code more than once. Maybe a language has a faster encoding of json but the other is faster for decoding because of the implementation in each one. And usually the person comparing tech A to tech B is expert with A and has a basic understanding of B, of course is easier for them to extract more performance of A.</p>
<p>But yeah, Go is fast, and you can build your web server, it will handle your load, you probably don’t need Rust or Zig for it. Remembering that the language is just part of your latency, usually we have lot’s of components on the way, containers clusters, lot’s of network hops, load balancers, api gateways etc…</p>
